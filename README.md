# ds-supplement

This experiment's purpose is to identify what factors impact player's salaries in the National 
Basketball Assosiation (NBA). I will be performing the stepwise selection method
to properly decide what is the best model. 

NOTE: This experiment can be greatly improved. Due to the limited space for the 
supplement, I will only be looking at AIC in  this experiment. Again, this is 
not advised as there are many other factors to consider during model selection, 
such as BIC, Mallows Cp, Adjusted R-squared, cross-validation, etc.
